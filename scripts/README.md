This creates a sentiment lexicon based on the work of Noval et al (2015).

We use the same cutoff as them (freq >=5) and scale maximum valence to
4, to match the vader lexicon.

Noval et al (2015): A lexicon of 751 emoji characters with
automatically assigned sentiment.  The sentiment is computed from
70,000 tweets, labeled by 83 human annotators in 13 European
languages.  The process and analysis of emoji sentiment ranking is
described in the paper:
